# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
## About
This is a sorting algorithm visualizer I developed for the "Create" portion of the 2020 AP Computer Science Principles exam. It scored 5/5.

It is written in Java using Java Swing to create the GUI and visualizations.

It features the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble
- Cocktail
- Inerstion
- Merge
- Quick
- Selection
- Stooge

The program shuffles the list of numbers before it runs the selected sorting algorithm, and then runs it. It can use any size of array and can be stopped midway through in case the algorithm takes too long.
